*** In order to hook 64 and 32 bit processes, you have to have 2 dlls (1 for 32 bit, and 1 for 64 bit processors)


*** If we navigate to Detours directory and launch:

>nmake

it will build the project and the dlls with 32-bit environment (only 32-bit applications can be intercepted)

*** To build dlls with 64-bit environment, use the following command on visual studio command prompt before building the project 
(becareful of the Visual Studio version type and path)

>SET DETOURS_TARGET_PROCESSOR=X64
>CALL "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
>NMAKE


*** Now, if we navigate to the Detour directory and write:

>nmake

It will build and inject simple64.dll inside the target process.
